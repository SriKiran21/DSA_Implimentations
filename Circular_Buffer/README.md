# Embedded DSA Utilities

This repository contains implementations of essential **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** specifically tailored for **Embedded Systems** and **Industrial Applications**.

These implementations are based on real-world scenarios and challenges Iâ€™ve encountered in embedded software development. The goal is to provide lightweight, efficient, and reusable DSA components suitable for resource-constrained environments.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Highlights

- Written in **Embedded C** for portability and performance.
- Focus on **low-level, memory-safe, and deterministic** behavior.
- Callback-based design for event-driven applications.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into any embedded project.

---

## ðŸ“š Included Data Structures

- [x] Circular Buffer (with callback support)
- [ ] Ring Buffer
- [ ] Queue (Static & Dynamic)
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Linked List (Singly)
- [ ] Hash Table (Open Addressing)
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (BST)
- [ ] Heap / Priority Queue
- [ ] State Machine Utilities

*(Work in progress â€” more to come!)*

## ðŸ’¡ Use Case Example

These utilities are suitable for:

- Sensor data buffering
- Communication protocol handling
- Real-time event queues
- Low-latency command processing
- State machine transitions in FSMs

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SriKiran21/DSA_Implimentations.git
cd DSA_Implimentations/Circular_Buffer

Use Provided Makefile to Run the Example.
